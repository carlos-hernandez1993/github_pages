### Projects

#### [EDA - Attendance at Sporting Events](https://github.com/carlos-hernandez1993/BOOTCAMP_EDA)
##### The theme chosen for the EDA consists of attendance at sporting events in the countries of the European Union (EU).
The theme chosen for the EDA is attendance at sporting events in the countries of the European Union (EU).
This theme was selected, since being always linked to the world of sport, I wanted to understand what are the reasons that condition attendance or not at these events.

The business of sport depends on the volume of spectators that elite competitions attract. The European Union (EU) is one of the largest markets in this segment after the United States, but attendance at sporting events is uneven across Europe.

From knowing what topic was going to be worked on, we proceeded to search for information that would provide useful data for the study. The data sources for the project were: Eurostat,
epdata,
Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte (Spain).
